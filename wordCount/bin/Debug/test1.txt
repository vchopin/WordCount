What is confidence? Confidence is to trust yourself. Confidence is to look upon yourself. 
It is not to indulge in self-admiration. It is not to get extremely arrogant. 
It is not to get dizzy with success or to be opinionated. 
It is just to inspire yourself ahead of a quality of mind, in high spirit, full of energy. 
It is to meet the challenges of life in a positive mood. 
It is to overcome your inferiority, farewell, to get rid of the trouble of a a ready-made panacea.
